# FLIXO Hub — Autonomous Repository Architecture & Tool Integration Execution Plan

## Mission

Achieve 100% verified completion of the browser-first tool expansion program: architecture, tool engines, tool integration, tests, localization, governance, documentation, and release verification.

## Current Autonomous Execution Session — 2026-10-03

- User-authorized mandate: execute the repository completion program continuously toward the defined 100% target.
- Working lane: `execution`; `main` remains production truth and promotion evidence must be exact-SHA bound.
- Initial workspace state: `c7b1362a5` was one commit ahead and two commits behind `origin/main`; the latest `origin/main` was integrated into `execution` before further changes.
- i18n normalization completed in this session: test suites now derive their locale matrix from `CANONICAL_LOCALES`; unsupported duplicate dictionary files `ur.ts` and `zh.ts` were removed.
- Current i18n structural gate after normalization: 20 canonical locales, 20/20 key coverage, zero extra dictionaries.

## Current Verified Baseline — 2026-10-03

- Production `main` merge SHA: `263827228cbe5f4851470297fde5f2858ff844de`.
- Production deployment: PASS; Cloudflare immutable identity and production browser verification both PASS on the exact merge SHA `263827228cbe5f4851470297fde5f2858ff844de` after a transient first-probe retry.
- Current canonical registry: 43 definitions; 42 tools are marked ready by the build/static-route generators.
- Canonical locale set: 20 locales. Automated dictionary-key coverage: PASS for all 20; no non-canonical locale dictionary files remain.
- Release agent runtime: deterministic browser-local Agent Guided Workflow is now being validated against the canonical ten-tool MVP; no external model/provider execution is required for the release gate.
- Windows build portability: PASS via `scripts/generate-build-artifacts.mjs`; full local build completed with exit code 0.
- Core verification: 19/19 tests PASS. The previous eight-route image-toolkit localization crash was fixed by binding each shared registry component to its canonical tool ID.
- The 200-tool expansion remains a separate target catalog. This release candidate is explicitly limited to the ten canonical MVP capabilities: six image + four video, with Manual + Agent verification.

## Non-negotiable operating rules

- `main` is production truth.
- Integration lane is `execution → main`; no direct main writes.
- No merge, deployment, destructive repository change, critical execution, or task closure without explicit human approval for that decision.
- No stale SHA evidence. Every certification claim is bound to the exact verified commit SHA.
- Skipped, cancelled, neutral, or unavailable checks are not PASS.
- Do not weaken branch protection or bypass required checks.
- `TOOL_REGISTRY` is the single canonical registry; do not create a second registry.
- Manual standalone workflow remains supported and is the primary execution path.
- User files must remain browser-local; no raw `File`/`Blob` is sent to an LLM, provider, or backend.
- New tools progress through `CANDIDATE → EXPERIMENTAL → ACTIVE` only after their contracts and verification gates pass.
- Third-party code/dependencies require license and supply-chain review before adoption.
- MVP scope remains frozen unless separately approved; the 200+ tool program is post-MVP expansion.

## Definition of Done

A phase is complete only when its implementation, tests, evidence, documentation, and review state are recorded here and verified against the exact commit SHA. The mission is complete only when all planned tools are operational, localized, tested, privacy-verified, and human-approved.

---

## Phase 1 — Plan Persistence & Repository Audit

### P1.1 Plan persistence

- [x] Persist this roadmap in `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.
- [x] Human pre-authorization for autonomous execution explicitly granted in the active mandate.

### P1.2 Baseline audit

- [x] Verify current `main` SHA and `execution` SHA.
- [x] Verify open PRs and required checks; PR #1000 was merged only after exact-SHA CI, browser smoke, trust-gate, and promotion proof passed.
- [x] Audit `TOOL_REGISTRY`, `TOOL_CATALOG`, executors, verifiers, recovery handlers, and runtime boundaries.
- [x] Inventory current canonical registry: 43 definitions; 42 ready tools in the current release surface; five Wave 1 image tools are implemented and classified `EXPERIMENTAL`, outside the frozen MVP executable set.
- [x] Map existing UI routes/components and canonical lazy-loaded tool definitions.
- [x] Inventory dependencies; identified missing PDF/advanced media/OCR/local-AI engine layer.
- [x] Audit i18n architecture; 20 canonical locales have lazy dictionary loaders. Full hardcoded-string audit remains.
- [x] Audit browser/network boundaries at the registry contract level; strict no-upload verification remains.
- [x] Audit existing CI/test architecture; repaired two lint defects found on the current execution head.
- [x] Produce baseline gap matrix in `docs/TOOL-EXPANSION-AUDIT.md`.

### P1.3 Audit output

- [x] Create the initial tool adoption baseline; detailed 200-row matrix remains a Phase 3 deliverable with license/engine evidence.
      `id | category | input | output | engine | offline | WASM | worker | mobile | bundle risk | license | priority | status`.
- [x] Establish classification policy; candidate-by-candidate classification remains part of Phase 3 admission.
- [x] Record current blockers/dependencies in `docs/TOOL-EXPANSION-AUDIT.md`.

---

## Phase 2 — Browser Capability Engine & Infrastructure

### P2.1 Core engines

- [x] Image engine baseline: Canvas, ImageData, and reusable browser-local image transforms; OffscreenCanvas worker migration remains for heavy operations.
- [x] Canonical MVP admission: the certified set is bound to canonical schemas, intents, local executors, output verifiers, bounded recovery, and Agent adapters.
- [ ] PDF engine: PDF.js + pdf-lib.
- [ ] Archive engine: JSZip and file streaming.
- [ ] Crypto engine: Web Crypto.
- [ ] Document engine: JSON/CSV/XML/YAML/Markdown/text processing.
- [ ] Video engine: WebCodecs/FFmpeg WASM where required.
- [ ] Audio engine: Web Audio API/FFmpeg WASM where required.
- [ ] OCR engine: browser/on-device OCR.
- [ ] Local AI engine: ONNX Runtime/WebGPU where appropriate.
- [ ] File persistence: IndexedDB and File System Access API where supported.
- [x] Cross-platform build artifact generation wrapper verified on Windows.

### P2.2 Runtime controls

- [ ] Web Worker execution for heavy operations (OCR/video workers exist; expansion-wide worker coverage remains).
- [ ] Lazy loading/code splitting per engine.
- [ ] File-size, memory, time, mutation, and output-size budgets.
- [ ] Abort/cancellation support.
- [ ] Deterministic error taxonomy.
- [ ] Fail-closed behavior for unsafe/unsupported execution.
- [ ] Recovery contracts for recoverable failures.

### P2.3 Privacy boundary

- [ ] Automated no-upload tests.
- [ ] Network interception tests for representative tools.
- [ ] Verify no user file bytes leave the browser.
- [ ] Self-host WASM/model assets where required for a strict offline claim.
- [ ] Document residual network requirements for assets that cannot be bundled.

### Tool admission gate

For every tool:

- [ ] Canonical registry entry.
- [ ] Input schema.
- [ ] Output contract.
- [ ] Executor binding.
- [ ] Verifier.
- [ ] Recovery behavior.
- [ ] Local/browser execution proof.
- [ ] Privacy/no-upload proof.
- [ ] Browser compatibility check.
- [ ] Mobile check where applicable.
- [ ] Arabic and English UI.
- [ ] Unit/integration/E2E coverage.
- [ ] License/dependency review.
- [ ] Performance/budget check.
- [ ] Only then promote to ACTIVE.

---

## Phase 4 — Complete Localization (i18n)

- [ ] Identify all supported languages from the repository's actual i18n configuration.
- [ ] Extract hardcoded user-visible strings.
- [ ] Extract validation and error messages.
- [ ] Extract tool metadata, labels, descriptions, empty states, progress states, and accessibility labels.
- [ ] Create synchronized translation dictionaries for every supported language.
- [x] Structural key-coverage gate verifies all 20 canonical locale dictionaries against English.
- [ ] Preserve technical identifiers in English where required.
- [ ] Verify Arabic RTL.
- [ ] Verify LTR languages.
- [ ] Test pluralization/interpolation.
- [ ] Test missing-key detection.
- [ ] Test untranslated-string detection.
- [ ] Test locale switching.
- [ ] Test tool routes and metadata in every locale.
- [ ] Do not claim “all target languages” until the repository's actual supported-language set is established and all are verified.

---

## Phase 5 — Sub-Agent Delegation & Governance

Sub-agents may be used for analysis/review tasks, but they do not receive authority to bypass repository governance.

### QA Agent

- [x] Define scope.
- [ ] Run/review unit and integration coverage.
- [ ] Track failures and regressions.
- [ ] Produce evidence bound to exact SHA.

### i18n Agent

- [x] Audit dictionaries.
- [x] Detect missing locale keys.
- [ ] Detect missing/untranslated strings.
- [ ] Verify RTL/LTR behavior.
- [ ] Produce localization evidence.

### Repo Maintainer Agent

- [x] Audit repository structure.
- [ ] Check documentation consistency.
- [ ] Validate branch/PR workflow.
- [ ] Detect stale references and duplicate registries.
- [ ] Report only; no autonomous merge/deploy/certification authority.

### Governance

- [ ] Human remains final authority.
- [ ] Agents cannot merge.
- [ ] Agents cannot deploy.
- [ ] Agents cannot alter branch protection.
- [ ] Agents cannot redefine MVP scope.
- [ ] Agents cannot certify their own work.
- [ ] All agent outputs require verification by an independent gate.

- [ ] Dependency/license audit.
- [ ] Full build.
- [ ] Full test suite.
- [ ] Production/browser verification after approved deployment.
- [ ] Human sign-off for every required state-changing decision.

---

## Phase 7 — Release & Certification

- [ ] Prepare release candidate on `execution`.
- [ ] Obtain explicit human approval for promotion.
- [ ] Open PR `execution → main`.
- [ ] Wait for all required checks.
- [ ] Reject skipped/cancelled/neutral checks as evidence of completion.
- [ ] Obtain explicit human approval to merge.
- [ ] Merge only after required checks pass.
- [ ] Verify `main` exact SHA after merge.
- [ ] Verify production deployment corresponds to that SHA.
- [ ] Run production browser verification.
- [ ] Record release evidence and URLs.
- [ ] Issue final completion certificate only after every criterion is verified.

## Completion Rule

Do not mark this mission complete, issue a final certificate, or report 100% completion until every unchecked item is verified, evidence is recorded against the exact SHA, required repository/production checks are PASS, and the corresponding human approvals are explicitly recorded.
